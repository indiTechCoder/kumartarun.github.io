I'm really excited to be talking at this conference two days. First, a workshop on Sass, Compass and building Semantic and responsive grids and then something a bit different. For the first time I'll be doing a non-technical talk where I get a chance to share a bit of history and how I became a content creator, joined Lynda.com and used a lot of the concepts that I've learned to flip my classrooms and make them more efficient.

## Building Semantic & Responsive Grids with Sass & Compass
### PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP
- **date:** Wednesday, April 29, 2-5 p.m.
- **location:** Lincoln Room

Building responsive grids with plain CSS can be challenging. Dealing with media queries, fractional widths and browser prefixes often prevent a designer from taking advantage from newer features like Flexbox, responsive grids and with Mobile-first design. Plus, Frameworks like Bootstrap can leave undesirable non-semantic layout code in your markup. In this session, we'll build a hotel website for the Landon Hotel using Sass along with Compass and two other libraries that will make designing semantic markup faster, easier and more efficient. You'll discover that using the right tools will make designing your sites unbelievably fun again.

## Turning Authorship Into a Career

Becoming an author is more than just a goal, it's a process. It all starts with developing a lifelong attitude towards learning and then turning that into a career that is dedicated to changing people's lives. In this session, Jen Jortner Cassidy will show you how to use online resources like Lynda.com to keep your skills up to date and help you achieve your personal and professional goals. More importantly the skills for becoming a successful, self-starter. Then, Lynda.com Staff Author with over 30 courses in the library, Author of Multimedia for Designers and Speaker Ray Villalobos will show you what it takes to get your ideas published, starting small, leveraging social media and learning the right people and lists to follow. He'll talk about getting a book deal, hardware and software you'll need for publishing video, flipping classrooms, speaking at conferences, how he landed his full-time Author position.
